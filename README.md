# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Description
This project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset, which includes information about the passengers on board the Titanic during its ill-fated maiden voyage in April 1912. The dataset contains various features such as passenger demographics, ticket class, and survival status. The analysis aims to uncover factors that influenced survival rates and gain insights into the tragic events surrounding the sinking of the Titanic.

## Analysis Workflow
 Data Cleaning
   - Loading the data
   - Checking for missing values
   - Removing duplicates
   - Fixing data types
   - Encoding categorical variables
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Descriptive statistics
   - Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analysis
 Modeling (if applicable)
