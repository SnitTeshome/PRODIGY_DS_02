## Description
This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset, which provides information about the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic during its ill-fated maiden voyage in April 1912. The dataset includes key details such as age, gender, class, and survival status. The primary goal is to explore these variables to uncover the factors that influenced survival rates and gain insights into the circumstances of this tragic event.

## Overview
In April 1912, the RMS Titanic embarked on its maiden voyage, a symbol of luxury and modern engineering. With over 2,200 passengers from diverse backgrounds—including wealthy elites, families, and hopeful immigrants—the Titanic was a microcosm of society at the time. Tragically, an iceberg collision on April 14 led to one of history’s most devastating maritime disasters.

Through this analysis, we examine passengers' demographics, social class, and survival outcomes. Key objectives include identifying the impact of age, gender, and class on survival rates and determining if women and children received priority during evacuation.

## Data Source
The dataset for this analysis is sourced from [Kaggle’s Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), containing comprehensive information about the passengers and their survival status.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SnitTeshome/PRODIGY_DS_02
cd PRODIGY_DS_02
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the analysis by executing the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts in this repository. Ensure you have Python and required libraries installed to successfully perform the analysis.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or run the Python scripts as desired.

## Data Exploration and Analysis
The analysis involves:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicate entries, and ensuring accurate data types.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating summary statistics to understand the distribution of variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigating relationships between features (age, gender, class) and survival outcomes.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Testing hypotheses about survival factors, such as whether social class or gender played a significant role.

## Visualization and Interpretation
Using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, we visualize the data to:
- Highlight survival trends across different passenger classes.
- Compare survival rates among age groups and genders.
- Examine the influence of passenger class on survival likelihood.

These visualizations help in interpreting and understanding the key factors influencing survival during the disaster.
