# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Description
## Description

In the spring of 1912, the RMS Titanic set sail on its maiden voyage, promising a journey of luxury and adventure across the Atlantic. It was a ship unlike any other, boasting the latest innovations in engineering and design, and it carried over 2,200 souls—each with dreams, hopes, and stories waiting to be told. From the wealthy elite enjoying sumptuous banquets in the grand dining halls to the hopeful immigrants crammed in the lower decks, the Titanic was a microcosm of society, filled with vibrant lives and aspirations.

However, as the Titanic glided through the serene waters, an unseen peril lurked in the dark depths of the ocean. On the night of April 14, a colossal iceberg lay in the ship's path, a silent giant that would soon change the course of history. At 11:40 PM, the unsinkable struck its fate, and chaos erupted as the ship began to sink. Panic ensued, as cries for help pierced the night and people rushed for the lifeboats, desperately seeking safety.

This project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset, a haunting reminder of that tragic night. The dataset captures critical information about the passengers on board—demographics such as age and gender, ticket class, and survival status. As we explore this data, we aim to uncover the factors that influenced survival rates amidst the chaos of that fateful night. Did social class determine who lived and who perished? Were women and children prioritized during the frantic evacuation? 

Through our analysis, we not only seek to understand the numerical data but also to illuminate the human experiences behind the statistics. Each row in the dataset represents a life—a unique story that was irrevocably altered by the events of April 15, 1912. By delving into these narratives, we honor the memories of those who were lost and those who survived, striving to glean insights from a tragedy that continues to resonate through time.



## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including their survival status.

## Analysis Workflow
1. Data Cleaning
   - Loading the data
   - Checking for missing values
   - Removing duplicates
   - Fixing data types
   - Encoding categorical variables
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Descriptive statistics
   - Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analysis
3. Modeling (if applicable)
   - Building predictive models to analyze survival factors

## Usage
To run the analysis, ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts provided in this repository.
